JavaScript Project --

# Modal
In this JavaScript project, we're going to create a modal window that is used to get users' attention and allow them to take note on something specific. --A good example of a modal window would be if a user made changes in a site without saving them and tried to go to another page. You can create a modal window that warns them to save their changes or else that information will be lost.--

The JavaScript key methods may be applied:


- document.querySelector()
--> Select the 1st element of CSS attribute '.modal-btn', '.modal-overlay', '.close-btn'.


- addEventListener()
--> Include an event listener to listen to an event 'click'.


- classList.add()
--> Return and add CSS classname of the element.


- classList.remove()
--> Return and remove CSS classname of the element.



That's a Wrap!
